This repo contains files of my work done at SAG DRDO in June-July 2024.

Work Description:
1. Developed **TinyML model** for gesture recognition on Embedded devices using TensorFlow Lite at **Scientific Analysis Group.**
2. Developed a **Rubber Ducky** device for automated command execution, utilizing VBScript to streamline execution of payloads on target systems.
